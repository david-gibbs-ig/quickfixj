This module is derived from the FIX Trading Community [fix-orchestra-quickfix](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-orchestra-quickfix).
Accordingly the Apache 2.0 license is applicable.

This module provides both QuickFIX/J Dictionary and code generation given a FIX Orchestra repository file.

This method of code generation is faster than the xslt transformations used to build from QuickFIX/J dictionary specifications.
It was not possible to meet build time constraints using the XSLT approach when building the complete FIX Latest standard.
